Automatically manage Telegram private channel subscribers via WooCommerce.

== Description ==

Automatically manage Telegram private channel subscribers via WooCommerce.

With WC Telegram Subscriber Manager Lite you can sell access to your private Telegram channels via a simple 
WooCommerce product. Following a successful checkout, users will be able to link to and submit an activation code in your chat bot.
This automatically generates an invite link for the user to click on. The invite link is validated in the back-end, and the user is automatically granted access.

== Features ==
* Grant access to a single private Telegram channel after successful WooCommerce checkout.
* You only need to enter your bot token and URL to get started.
* Automatticaly retrieve channel ID.
* Telegram user ID's automatically retrieved and validated during activation.
* Set channel access to any Simple product in WooCommerce.
* Secure webhook checks.

Note, in the Lite version channel members are not automatically removed. They can be removed manually from within Telegram.

== Pro version (coming soon) ==
* Control access to **unlimited** Telegram private channels.
* Control access to multiple channels per product. 
* Use with both Simple and Subscription products in WooCommerce.
* Automatically removes channel members when their subscriptions expire.
* Members won't be removed from channels if they have multiple subscriptions and at least one is still active.
* Works best with WooCommerce Subscriptions. Other subscription plugin add-ons coming soon.
* Set access expiry for Simple products (automatically removes members on expiration).
* Set order cancellation access cut-off to match a refund policy (members can be optionally instantly removed if they cancel their purchase within the cut-off period).

After plugin activation plugin settings are in **WooCommerce > Settings** in the **Telegram Subscriber Manager** tab.
